# read-Me
This is Hackathon@SG hack that I worked on with 3 other teammates, Jern-Kuan Leong, Mingwei Shen and Nelson Wei Tan in June 2015.
read.Me is an iOS app that utilizes APIs provided by the National Library Board of Singapore and Goodreads to present the user with a list of recommended book titles based on a keyword search.
I worked on implementing the View Controllers as well as integrating the APIs written by my other groupmates.

Note: This contains the .swift files and not a fully working Xcode project.
